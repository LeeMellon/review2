#_{Voit-cough-Programming-Language-Survey}_

#### _{A web app designed to help the user decide which programming language best suits them. Also may tell you if you're a Cylon or a Replicant.}_

#### _{By Ian Goodrich}_

## Description

_{Presents the user with a series of questions to help determine which coding language and as such which area of the larger field of professional coding  they may want to explore. To this end each available response is weighted (based on what each question says about the respondents propensity or proclivity for aesthetic appreciation, social interaction, and front or backend work)to reflect which language is most and least represented by a given answer. In order to avoid simple "black-or-white" results, this "weighting" is done along a spectrum of 1 to 0 with .25 increments. }_

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
